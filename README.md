No heroes and no vilains  
Incremental help is better than disruptive behavior  
Communication is a problem and centralization still looms  
Efficiency is a challenge but it must be pursuit  
can't complain if you are not there  
fix instead of criticize  
forgiveness is better than permission  
because one can is not a reason to do it  
because it should be done is a reason to do it
