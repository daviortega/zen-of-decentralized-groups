No heroes and no vilains  
Incremental help is better than disruptive behavior  
Communication is a problem and centralization still looms  
Efficiency is a challenge but it must be pursuit  
Can't complain if you are not there  
Fix instead of criticize  
Forgiveness is better than permission  
Because one can is not a reason to do it  
Because it should be done is a reason to do it  
Coordination without delegation  
Don't just be the "idea" person
